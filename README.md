# CryptoFlip

## Overview

This project features a blockchain-based coinflip game where users can connect their MetaMask wallets to bet Ethereum tokens. Participants have the chance to double their stake based on the outcome of a coin toss. The application is designed to provide a straightforward and user-friendly experience, enabling users to interact with decentralized technology on the Ethereum blockchain without needing extensive prior knowledge.

## Features

- #### Blockchain Integration: 
Users can connect their wallets via the Ethereum testnet environment.
- #### Gameplay Mechanics: 
After connecting their wallet, users can choose the amount of Ethereum tokens (ETH) to bet and select either heads or tails for the coinflip.

- #### Winnings Calculation: 
If the coin lands on the userâ€™s chosen side, their stake is doubled and returned to their wallet. If not, the stake is forfeited.

- #### Responsive UI/UX: 
The game features a clean, modern interface that ensures usability across various devices and screen sizes.

- #### Testing and Validation: 
The platform has been rigorously tested to ensure functionality and reliability, with all interactions being verifiable on blockchain explorers like Etherscan.
